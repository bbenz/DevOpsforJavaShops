# Workshop: DevOps for Java Shops

>DevOps is great, if you have the people, processes and tools to support it.  In this session I’ll highlight the easiest ways for developers to work with their IT organizations and partners to deliver their Java code to the cloud using GitHub, including the best ways to reliably make updates and maintain production java code. The focus is on real-world examples using command line tools, free tools including GitHub Actions, and free SDKs and tools available on GitHub. 


## Workshop delivery 
I'm happy to deliver this workshop virtually at destinations worldwide, and also to support anyone else who wants to deliver this, especially in local languages.
